The work written here is based on so many sources, I have gathered so far. One is from an online course by Duke University, the other being the material from Tim Bulchaka one of the best educators, some material have been obtained from Mosh Hamedani (https://codewithmosh.com).
I will flow haphazardly but will soon rearrange everything into an order that can be referenced.

Lets go:
Java Programming: Solving Problems using programming

 - Understanding Variables and Data Types:
Programs are meant to process data, they are the virtual abstraction of the computer, they take in data, process it and give out information. data consists of values. These values have a nature. A nature of the data is what is called data types. In order for the computer processor to deal with data it has to know the nature of the data. Some programming languages require the nature of this data to be known first hand , these languages are known as statically typed languages, while some do not require the nature of the data to be known first hand and the languages are called losely typed language or dynamically typed languages. 
 
 - Even though there are losely typed languaged and strictly typed ones all languages process some form of values that data holds, java has its own too.

   - Numbers in java are presented as of two basic types that is
	1. Integers which are whole numbers 
		These can also be sub categorized based on the amount of space they hold in the memory, for example
		Byte these ones are holding 8bit number hence the range of coverage is also gained through that same nature in negative side and positive side first number range from -128 to +127. And numbers must range in between the given range

		Short are 16bit whole numbers that is it convers a range of numbers from 2^16 to 2^16-1
                Integer is the default one and it is a 32bit based number which covers numbers from which cover a range of 2^32 to 2^32-1 range
		Long is the last type of whole number which cover largest numbers, it is covering a range of
